## Testing

Early on in this project I decided to move from Gitpod to using my local machine to eradicate some of the complications that that IDE was presenting. I decided to used Visual Studio Code 3 (vscode), and before I set up Travis for dedicated bug/failure tracking, I made use of PyLint to help avoid simple errors (although Pylint had shotcomings when it came to recognising that certain classes had certain members).
